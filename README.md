Welcome to **Craft Block Trails**!

## Tagline

Craft Block is a fan-builder application for small businesses. The goal is to increase brand loyalty, advocacy, and community by building an emotional connection between businesses and their customers

## The problem it solves

Quality, fair pricing, and great customer service don't turn customers into fans. Today's buyers expect retailers to provide this level of service. Customers want a more immersive experience when they shop that loyalty programs were never designed to provide. Additionally, storefront and online businesses don't collect the zero-party and first-party data or have the technology required to create immersive customer experiences. To worsen the problem, using cookies to collect customer data needs a major overhaul because of government regulations.

Craft Block Fan Builder unlocks a new world of benefits, helping grow a business by creating a more immersive customer buying journey through our ability to anticipate and recognize customer sentiment and optimize the customer experience based on keeping your customers engaged. Craft Block Fan builder benefits organizations by lowering transaction costs, more immersive gamification, member-only interactivity, better control of personal data by members, transferability and ownership of digital assets, traceability, multiple business interactivity, and improved fraud prevention. Craft Block allows businesses to create deeper connections with their customers and build a stronger sense of community. 

## Challenges I ran into

As part of the Flow hackathon's development process, I encountered the following challenges during the project build process. 

Flow blockchain setup: During this process, connecting the front end with capabilities and calling specific functions was one of the biggest challenges. Building flow capabilities that call specific contract features caused several back and forth in my design decisions. Building logic to update contract-specific needed to be clarified, and took time to figure out when interacting between NFT, Collection, and other resources.

Minting resources that own other resources: I needed to save the main Quest resource and add additional resources for Quest Actions. I was able to get one to one relationship, but I need to get one quest to many Quest Actions. 

Time Management: I needed more time; although I had a good start to an idea attempting to implement all the functions and capabilities during a 2 week sprint proved challenging. It was a combination of learning and executing to build each feature. At the end of the day, it came down to building a proof of concept highlighting idea concepts.

## Technology I used

Used several front-end and back-end technologies. RedwoodJS was the framework used to build the site. The primary reason is to help accelerate assembling of a production-ready set of components. I used React, Tailwind, Flow blockchain, Flow FCL, and Blocto Wallet.

I am hosting the application on Vercel. 

As I build this product, I will use the API back-end to connect to Supabase, Prisma, and GraphQL to create templates and random trait programs.

Once we start consumer interactions, we will use the Sales Funnel tool to move them through the onboarding and sales process. We aim to allow users to stay engaged with Craft Block as we do special promotions.
